# Dino-Game
The Chrome Dino game is a simple infinite runner, which sees you jump over cacti, and dodge underneath obstacles. Controls are basic. Press space to jump (and to start the game), and the down arrow to duck. The goal is to survive for as long as humanly (or dinosaurly) possible. The Chrome Dino game boasts impressive numbers especially for something that is largely hidden from view.
